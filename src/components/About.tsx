        I'm a data engineer with over three years of experience in the retail and telecom industries, focused on building and optimizing data pipelines that support real business outcomes. I'm skilled in SQL, Python, and PySpark, and have worked with tools like Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Spark Streaming to manage large-scale data workflows. From automating ETL processes to cleaning complex datasets and tuning performance, I enjoy solving practical data challenges. I'm also familiar with cloud platforms like GCP and AWS, and enjoy using tools like Power BI and Tableau to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
